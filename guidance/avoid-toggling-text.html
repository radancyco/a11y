title: "Avoid Toggling Text"
---

<p>Toggling text in a control to indicate a state change should be avoided where possible. For example, click on the following button:</p>

<button class="btn" id="toggleExample">Save Job</button>

<h2>Cons</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Changing text may not announce the state change to assistive technology users.</li>
    <li>Changing text removes the initial context of the control, which can be confusing for assistive technology users upon returniung to the control later, especially if <code>aria-expanded</code> or <code>aria-pressed</code> are used.</li>
</ul>

<p>Instead of changing text, use visual affordance to convey state change. This is a well-known and quickly understood convention. For example, up and down arrows, check mark, plus and minus, etc.</p>

<button class="btn" id="toggleExample">Save Job</button>

<h2>Pros</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Univeral in that it behaves the same for everyone. Disabled users hear a single state chnage, via ARIA. While non-disabled users see the single state change.</li>
	<li>Using a single instruction means there is less text to translate.</li>
    <li>Less code to write</li>
    <li>Users are well-adept at using such interfaces. Afterall, if they knew how to open or save it, a text instruction to close or unsave it, is not really necessary.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Use Cases</h2>

<p>Using our screen reader, let's see how each of these scenarios sound:</p>


  <script>

	function toggleText1() {

  	    var x = document.getElementById("toggleExample");

	    if (x.getAttribute("aria-pressed") === "false") {

		    x.textContent = "Job Saved";
		    x.setAttribute("aria-pressed", "true");

	    } else {

		    x.textContent = "Save Job";
		    x.setAttribute("aria-pressed", "false");

	    }

	}

	</script>
