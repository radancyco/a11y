This issues also appears to be present on all pages of the applications, not just the login and registration form screens. Preventing a user the ability to pinch and zoom in on the application (no all of your users are on desktop), is a barrier for those with low vision. Here is the code in question: \n\n{code}<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\"/>{code}\n\nPlease remove  \"maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\"\n\n*Testing Criteria:* \n\nLook to see that meta element has been corrected and that pinch and zoom are now available on mobile devices. \n\n*Links:* \n\nhttps://app.brazenconnect.com/cc/#!login \n\nhttps://app.brazenconnect.com/cc/#!mfa  \n\nhttps://app.brazenconnect.com/app/password-change#!setPassword \n\nhttps://app.brazenconnect.com/app/events/dbJPJ/identify-peer-group#!eventRegistration;eventCode=dbJPJ;registrationEditMode=false \n\nhttps://app.brazenconnect.com/events/dbJPJ/login \n\n*Screenshot/Video/URL:* \n\nhttps://radancy.dev/a11y/audit/client/hiring-events/screengrab/A11YFORMS001.png\n\n*Note:* This appears to be a global issue throughout the application. Instead of the auditor calling it out on every page that is tested, we will expect the Hiring Events team to take note of it here and then make sure it is addressed application-wide. Auditor will spot-check pages to ensure that issue is no longer present and will bring attention to again, if needed, during future audits.","issuetype": {

This is because absolute units, like px, are used in the CSS. This also appears to be a global issue within the entire application. Revising the UI and using relative units, such as rem or em or %, will go a long way in creating a more flexible environment that anybody can use. Please reach out if any guidance is needed. Auditor assumes this may need a great deal of time to get right, possibly Q3\n\nTo duplicate, go into Chrome settings and increase text to 32px (200%) and return to the interface, here you will see that the UI's text size has not increased at all. \n\n*Testing Criteria:* \n\nRun steps above and ensure that text is enlarging properly. When increasing text size, the UI does not need to be perfect, but all text should be accessible, without the presence of overlapping content of horizontal scrolling. \n\n*Links:* \n\nhttps://app.brazenconnect.com/cc/#!login \n\nhttps://app.brazenconnect.com/cc/#!mfa  \n\nhttps://app.brazenconnect.com/app/password-change#!setPassword \n\nhttps://app.brazenconnect.com/app/events/dbJPJ/identify-peer-group#!eventRegistration;eventCode=dbJPJ;registrationEditMode=false \n\nhttps://app.brazenconnect.com/events/dbJPJ/login \n\n*Screenshot/Video/URL:* \n\nhttps://radancy.dev/a11y/audit/client/hiring-events/screengrab/A11YFORMS004.mp4\n\nhttps://radancy.dev/a11y/audit/client/hiring-events/screengrab/A11YFORMS004.png ","issuetype": {
