When I zoom in to 400% and resize my browser window to 1280x1024 (the conditions required for the test), the navigation opens and appears to overlap all page content. Please ensure that this behavior does not occur under these conditions. This issue has been reported by clients as well, in their own testing.\n\n*Links:* \n\nhttps://app.brazenconnect.com/app/events/LrNMp#!lobby;eventCode=LrNMp","issuetype": {
