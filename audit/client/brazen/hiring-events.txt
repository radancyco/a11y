Support link should be encapsulated in a <li> element, like the dropdown next to it. The link is not read as a part of the list, which is should be.

Remove role="form" from form element.

Page needs h1

Make this your h1, style as needed to retain same look and feel. Headings must never be selected based on size, but used for structural meaning to better understanding.

General note - look into forms using autocomplete for redundant information.

Event Registration

https://app.brazenconnect.com/app/events/dbJPJ/identify-peer-group#!eventRegistration;eventCode=dbJPJ;registrationEditMode=false




All options in the select dropdown appear to have aria on them that is not required. Please remove these attributes: 

role="option"

aria-selected="true"

These roles and states are typically used with custom built components, not with native HTML, whic already has these properties built in.

axe is reporting 379 instances of this issue. 


------

Select fields apepar to have aria on them that is meant for custom built components. Please remove following from all select fields: 

aria-multiselectable="false" 

https://app.screencast.com/2PTA8DR2vnBtd 

-----

The multiselect form included aria that is should have. 

Remove aria-multselect="true"

https://app.screencast.com/RMyAure4PwJmo

Using ARIA attributes in roles where they are not allowed can interfere with the accessibility of the web page. Using an invalid role-attribute combination will, at best, result in no effect on the accessibility of the application and, at worst, may trigger behavior that disables accessibility for entire portions of an application.


----

Regarding multiselect boxes. I strong consider removing these as an option from your admin form and instead rely on the possibly using checkboxs, possibly in a disclosure. Multiselct can't be used by many disabled people. 


----


When magnifying content to 200%, an overlay appears that decreases contrast across the board. 


-----


Page title "Event Registration" does not describe the event the user is registering for.


-----

Field-level error messages are not provided for any form fields. Errors are provided at the top of form.


(is this a bad thing? - double check?)

------


No errors are programmatically associated to their respective form fields.


-----


No form fields that collect information about the user have the autocomplete attribute.


-----

On profile picture, when remove button is clicked on, the focus needs to be placed on choose image. removing a button that has focus on it is not a good idea. 



----

in left nav, when profile or edit password are click on, the title should be changed. 

need to find out about focus - don;t think it needs to be managed here. 

----

"Event Registration" should be h1. See https://app.screencast.com/jvDY7JL8KroiH

monday - deep analysis of each fied in registration for and test the profile and edit password forms.
