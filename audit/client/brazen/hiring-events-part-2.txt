Candidate Landing Page

  Landing Page Builder




   Basic Landing Page - All landing pages appear to have same issue. 

	keyboard

		Issue: There are elements on the page that receive focus which should never receive focus. Non-interactive elements must never be focusable, unless it is temporary and needs to occur via managed means. Also, when tabindex is removed from elements, there will no longer be a need for attributes like aria-hidden="false" and aria-labelledby, so please remove.

		Issue: When pressing "Reserve My Spot" I am brought to the top of the page

		General markup fixes. 

			Issue: Remove role="heading" and replace element with a proper h1. Adjust styling as needed to accomodate the change.

			https://bugherd-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/msajouuoslsw7fqwqjoumw/2024-06-27_09-44-56.png

			all landing pages - Issue: Add a null alt (alt="") to Brazen logo in footer. If the images is non-decorative, then add a value like "Brazen" (or "Radancy" if it swapped out). 

			https://www.bugherd.com/t/e6JhD1pIC3Av45TIEN6biQ

			Issue: Regions are present that have no accName (accessible name). Please remove from following elements: 

			<div class="area" role="region" id="how-it-works-area">
			<div class="area translucent-bg parallax-wrapper" role="region" id="illustrations-area">
			<div class="area white-bg" role="region" id="about-us">
			<div class="area hidden-xs" role="region" id="user-quotes">
			<div class="area translucent-bg parallax-wrapper" role="region" id="bottom-registration">
			<div role="region" id="footer">

Heading updates

		See following screenshots. Making these actual headings will allow assisitve technology users to better understand and navigate the page. Adjust CSS as needed.

Heading Cleanup 

Review all headings on page any remove any redundancies you may come across. For example, a hheading that is marked-up as h2, does not require role="heading" aria-level="2"



-----

form on this page

"Issue: Provide a visible, persistent label for each form field. Including or visually hiding the <label> element is not accessible, nor is placeholder text a satisfactory replacement. Fields that do not have visible, persistent labels after entering information may be problematic for users who may not remember what information the form field was requesting, etc. When labels are reinstated properly, the title attribute may also be removed. This is what auditor will expect to see: https://app.screencast.com/lcpGhADbQxmS5 

Testing Criteria: Ensure that visible labels are present and marked up properly. "





    Legacy Landing Page

Focus style on "Register Now" button should match hover style.

empty heading found - please remove.

----- 

This register button is not receiving focus when tabbed to. There is a tabindex="-1" on it. Why? 

----


How it works need to be restructured to make more sense. 

This section should be a list, with proper heading use. I'm seeing across application that headings are selected for size and not their semantic relevance and used inappropriately in general. Would like to have 1:1 with Kate and team to discuss this issue further as the problem is too numerous to keep citing cross-platform. However, in this example, we appear to have the following: 

<div ...>

	<h1>1</h1>

	<h2>Register</h2>

	<p>Create an account....</p>

</div>

Ideally, we would change to the following: 

<ol>

	<li>

		<h3><span class="step">1</span> Register</h3>

		<p>Create an account...</p>

	</li>

	...

</ol>

Time Module improvements needed

This is backwards. The h3 headings used here should be revered with their content. For example, "Date" should be your heading (h3) and October 31 should be your text element (p). I would also mark-up Date, Start and End time as list.

Heading is incorret. 

No focus outline can be seen. 

The help icons which shows a tooltip is inaccessible to keybaord and screen reader users. 

The compontent used to select a month to review events: 

Using an input without an accessible name (why use an input to begin with?). 

No announcement made that there is new content on page and how may events are available for that month, etc.
