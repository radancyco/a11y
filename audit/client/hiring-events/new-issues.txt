add a propler label

we need to announce how may chracters are left to at when typing

when pressing cancel or sent, focus needs ot be brought back to last element that opned up, in the case, the "leave a note" button.

Discussion 

add proper label to field. 

Focus keeps getting lost when I hit enter. I then have to tab back to the section. 

When i delete a comment, focus is lost again, sending me back to beginning of page, I would probably place focus on next active comment, via tabindex -1. 

when i type a comment in and hit "post", focus is lost again. In this scenario I would place focus on the field. 

see if comment coming in announces, ask beth to send message. 

see if region scrollable. it probably isn't.

A11YSCHEDULE001 

The Lobby card, "Your Schedule" has no keyboard support at all due to a -1 tabindex and aria-hidden="true". Please remove these.

Before: 

<button type="button" class="btn btn-xs btn-primary" tabindex="-1" aria-hidden="true">Manage</button>

After: 

<button type="button" class="btn btn-xs btn-primary">Manage</button>

----

A11YSCHEDULE002

The "Schedule" modal has the following keyboard access issues. 

1. The Tab UI cannot be accessed, as links appear to all have a tabindex of -1. This Tab UI also appears to have many of the defencies as has been cited elsewhere across similir interfaces, across application. Would strongly consider rebuilding it and ensuring consistet use across application or leveraging custom code we have available for such interfaces, if that is even possible here. If it is not possible to leverage this code, at least look to it for guidance on how these types of components should behave. See https://radancy.dev/component-library/tablist/

1. Toggle buttons missing focus state (they are also not reading back correctly, see video, I hear "switch on" and not the time/availability detailes.). Whwn tabbing through the list of available times, no focus state is present.

The "Advanced Filters" fields have seveers issues. I'm going to need to swing back to this one, post audit, to write out a full recomendation on how to proceed on this one.

A11YSCHEDULE010.png

The table os available registrants is largely inaccessible and I cannot access the Status dropdown at all, via keyboard. This particual portion of the UI should be built using a button. As it appears to be a toogle, be sure to provide state change of button by including aria-exanded, etc.

In "Invite to Chat" section, remove tabindex="0" from surrounding elements. (.chat-partner-card)

Remove "empty" alt text. (move to global) 


A11YGLOBAL012.png

The "Thanks for your interest!" does nto have a proper accessible name. While it is 
using aria-describedby, it should really be using aria-labeledby and pointing to a 
less verpose accName (right now it is pulling in the entire paragraph, "Please leave a note....") or using aria-label="Leave a Note" or point to h4 (whcih should be an h1 actually)
