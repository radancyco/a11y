 When configuring a screen reader, users select a default language. If the language of a webpage or app is not specified, the screen reader assumes the default language set by the user. Language settings become an issue for users who speak multiple languages and access website in more than one language. It is essential to specify a language and ensure that it is valid, so website text is pronounced correctly.
 
 Screen readers use different sound libraries for each language, based on the pronunciation and characteristics of that language. Screen readers can switch between these language libraries easily, but only if the documents specify which language(s) to read and when. If the language is not specified, the screen reader reads the document in the user's default language, resulting in a strange accent!

While the carousel can be tabbed to, the focus appears to land out of view or ""under"" the primary content area on the left. This is not acceptable, as people with low vision who also use a keyboard to navigate will not be able to tell where they are. For screen reader users, there are other critical elements that appear to be missing, and there is also improper use of ARIA. Please see screengrab. 
 
A carousel component requires the following key elements to work more broadly and for more users. These are as follows:
 
1. An accessible name (accName), description, and role.
 
2. Navigational buttons must include an accessible name.
 
3. Pressing navigation buttons should indicate that a new slide is in view and which slide one is on (e.g., Data-Driven Recruitment in the Age of AI - Radancy Blog, Slide 3 of 7). Here we will require _aria-live_.
 
4. Tabbing should be confined to the visible slide only. Continuing to tab should bring the user to navigation buttons or to other components on the page. Focus should not land on any hidden content.
 
5. Links within the slide should be more discernible (they should also be link--not buttons). We can use _aria-describedby_ to link the blog post title if we want.
 
6. Links that open in new windows should indicate the same to assistive technology as well. Either use an image with alt text or visually hidden text. 
 
7. On mobile devices, arrow buttons must be present. 
 
Please review the example posted in the delivery component library, as it will help guide product during remediation. See https://radancy.dev/component-library/carousel/  
 
Alternatively, we may also wish to see if Angular has a better-built carousel component available. However, it should be reviewed _carefully_ before integrating it into the product.

1. Buttons receive focus, but there is no state announced when pressing them. Here, _aria-expanded_ will be required.
 
2. When disclosure is opened the next tab stop should be within the input field and then subsequent tab stops should jump into the list below the input. However, these listing do not appear to be interactive. Instead, my focus moves to next interactive element _outside_ of disclosure before returning to the input field in the disclosure. Likely the disclosures are at the bottom of the page, rather than directly below the button. If we cannot move these disclosures, then focus management will be required. 
 
3. Overall, the accessibility of the component is so poor, it is recommended that a different disclosure component, with predictive search be used, etc., but we will revisit this.

Before arriving at a solution, we need to ask ourselves whether hiding these critical links is even necessary. If there is no valid reason to hide them, it is *strongly* recommended that we allow these links to always remain visible. This is the easiest solution, and it would also resolve the issue of them being unavailable on mobile (was this even tested on mobile?).
 
However, the link must include an _href_ attribute so that it becomes keyboard-focusable, even if it means using a null value such as _href=""#""_. Links without an _href_ cannot be focused via keyboard, regardless of whether they are hidden or not. Adding _tabindex=""0""_ is not acceptable, as it removes the link’s native role and behavior.
 
If we want to retain the current behavior, then the CSS will likely need to be adjusted. Now, a wrapper element reveals a child element on _:hover_. In addition to _:hover_, we will need to include _:focus-within_ and remove display: none. Like a “skip link,” the child element should be visually hidden offscreen and brought into view when it receives hover or focus. See example here:

*Personal Information Form*
 
*Note:* Many of these same form issues were seen in other forms within the application, so consider this guidance for those as well, though each forms unique issues will be cited separately. 
 
1. Avoid _role=""alert""_ on individual field errors
 
Using _role=""alert""_ on each field error is disruptive and overwhelming for users, especially screen reader users.
 
Instead, use inline error messages with aria-describedby:
 
{code}<input ... aria-describedby=""error-id"">
 <span id=""error-id"">First Name is required.</span>{code}
 
On submission, focus should move to the first invalid field. A single _role=""alert""_ may be used at the top of the form for a general message, e.g.:
 
{code}<p role=""alert"">The form contains errors. Please correct them.</p>{code}
 
2. Use the native _required_ attribute
 
Form fields (input, select, etc.) should include the required attribute. The visual asterisk can remain but should be hidden from assistive technology:
 
{code}<label ... >First Name <span aria-hidden=""true"">*</span></label>
 
<input required ... >{code}
 
3. Form success messaging
 
After a successful submission, consider displaying a confirmation on the next page—e.g., “Step 1 completed successfully.” We may need UX input for the final messaging. If this is a multi-step process, make that clearly communicated so users understand where they are in the flow.
 
4. Submission issues with screen readers
 
In testing with NVDA and JAWS on Chrome, form submission behavior appeared inconsistent. May be impacting other browser/AT combos as well. This needs further investigation.
 
5. Form Instructions
 
At the top of each form, include instructional text such as: “Fields marked with an asterisk (*) are required.”*",TBD ,"https://radancy.dev/a11y/audit/client/erp/screengrab/A11YERP030-1.png

In many cases, these tooltips might be considered superfluous; however, this can be subjective depending on who is performing the evaluation. That said, there are instances where tooltips contain critical information, such as when uploading a résumé, which includes details like allowed file types and maximum file size. *This information must be fully accessible to all users.*
 
Tooltips are a controversial component in both web design and accessibility communities. Further analysis and discussion will be necessary before determining the best approach. While designers may favor tooltips for reducing visual clutter, we must consider all possibilities—including removing them altogether across products if accessibility cannot be ensured. Toggle tips may also be a better alternative to a hover tooltip, as well. 
 
Let’s revisit this issue as we get closer to planning a future sprint. Just wanted to log it as point of concern for us.

Two possible solutions include Toggle Tips or Tooltips that are simply better built with accessibility in mind. The latter option will require more testing though before implementations.

When a user encounters this presentation, they reasonably expect standard dialog functionality, such as focus being moved into the dialog, an accessible name (aria-labelledby or aria-label), and keyboard focus trapping within the dialog.
 
Currently, because the disclosure overlays the entire viewport, tab navigation can move behind the open panel, leading to potential confusion and focus loss.
 
To prevent false affordances and focus management issues (which can occur even on mobile devices with external keyboards), the recommendation is to align the mobile behavior with the desktop implementation. Specifically, the disclosure panel should not occupy the full viewport but instead expand beneath the associated disclosure buttons. This approach should address the accessibility concerns in the updated design.
