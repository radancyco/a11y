*TODO*

1. Move _aria-describedby_ from the outer element _(.has-error)_ to the _select_ element. The value, in this example _error-link-gwt-uid-596_, should be dynamically appended at validation time. The _aria-describedby_ attribute can accept multiple values, separated by spaces.
2. Remove _aria-describedby_ on the outer element _(.bzInput)_ and append its value, in this example, _gwt-uid-398_, to _aria-describedby_ attribute now on the _select_ element.
3. As has been suggested in other reported issues, please also remove unnecessary ARIA attributes, such as _aria-multiselectable_, _aria-selected_ (use the native _selected_ attribute or nothing at all), and _role=""option""_. These attributes are meant for custom comboboxes (when we are using a native _select_ element), so removing them will keep your code cleaner, lighter, maintainable, and reduce the risk of automated accessibility issues being cited.
4. Do similar for other elements, like _input_. However, we may wish to hold off input types of _radio_ and _checkbox_, as they may require slight different, custom approaches to handling validation.

Disabled users have certain expectations as to how tabs should operate which Radancy is not meeting here. 

The list items are particularly problematic.

</li>{code}

**TODO** 

1. Add **role=""presentation""** to each **li**. Since the **ul** has **role=""tablist"""", this is no longer a text list, but a tablist, so child elements must have their list semantics replaced with **""presentation""**. Getting semantics correct is critical to help convey understanding of the structure being engaged with by people using assisitve technology.  

2. Change **href=""javascript:;** to **href=""#""**. For future-friendly enhancement I may ask for. Replacing with hash should not be an issue if return false is used on the link, which it likely is already. 

3. Move **role=""tab""**, **aria-controls**, and **aria-selected** to the link itself. ARIA like this should never be used on non-interactive elements like **li**, unless tabindex is present. However, we want to avoid using tabindex here so as to avoid a **double tab**, so moving these attributes to the link or button is always the best option. 

4. If **aria-label** is not needed here, and I seee no reason why it should be, then please remove it. 

5. Remove **tabindex** from link. The tabindex is redundant and not required on interactive elements like <a> or <button> as they can **already be tabbed to without it**.

6. Give each link a unique ID. For example, **id=""tab-item-01""**. This will be used by the content panel below the list. 

The tab panels themselves could must be improved as well: 

**Before:** 

{code}<div class=""tab-pane fade active in"" id=""gwt-uid-5"" role=""tabpanel"" aria-hidden=""false"" tabindex=""0""> ... </div>{code}

**After:** 

{code}<div class=""tab-pane fade active in"" id=""gwt-uid-5"" role=""tabpanel"" aria-hidden=""false"" aria-labelledby=""tab-item-01"" tabindex=""0""> ... </div>{code}

1. Add **aria-labelledby** to the tab panel and reference the ID of the newly added ID on the link. Doing so is good practice and provides context as to which tab is currently in use. 

Keyboard support needs MUCH improvement here to comply. Arrow key support is an expectation here. 

1. When user presses the right or down arrow key, the focus should move from the active tab the user is currently on, to the inactive tab on the right, making the active and previous tab inactive. 

2. When the user presses the left or up arrow key, the focus should move from the active tab the user is currently on, to the inactive tab on the left, making the active and previous tab inactive. 

3. The tabs should cycle endlessly when tabbed though. In other words, moving left or right will bring user to an inactive tab, thereby making it active.

4. Inactive tabs and panels should always be set to **tabindex=""-1""**, which currently appears to be present, so no action currently required. 

5. Tabbing from an active tab should bring user to the active tab panel only. This currently occurs but the focus is being suppressed here, which appears to be a much larger issue application-wide. 

6. Tabbing from the active tab panel should bring user to the active tab only. This currently occurs but the focus is being suppressed here, which appears to be a much larger issue sitewide.

**TODO**

1. Replace **role=""tab""** with **role=""button""** as this is a button and not a tab. 

2. Add **aria-controls** and point it to the same target as **data-target** (but without the hash). 

3. Replace **h4** with a span element. There are too many issues on the app with headings and I feel that unnecessary headings likely will cause more of an issue than the benefit they provide. Normally, I would not remove headings and there may be a future where I ask Radancy to reintroduce them, but I think we can do without them for now. 

4. Is this following necessary? If not, remove **<span class=""small"" aria-hidden=""true"" style=""display: none; margin-left: 8px;""></span>**

5. On **.material-icons**, remove **aria-label=""Close panel""**, set **aria-hidden=""true""**, and remove the text, **""keyboard_arrow_up""**.

6. On the disclosure content div (**.panel-collapse**), please remove **aria-expanded**. This is not allowed on non-interactive elements.

7. On the disclosure content div (**.panel-collapse**), please add **aria-labelledby** and point it towards the ID of the button, in this example, **aria-labelledby=""gwt-uid-10""**.

1. When the ""Edit"" button is pressed, place **tabindex=""-1""** and focus on the **outer** parent element (**.panel-collapse**).

2. When the ""Cancel"" button is pressed, keyboard focus should be placed on the edit button again.

When reinstating the label, the placeholder text should also be removed, especially if it creates a redundancy. The only exception here is if it is useful and required to indicate suggective, but non-critical data to be input into the field, for example, phone number formatting, When I say non-critial, the form will not throw an error if formatting because backend programming is going to take care of the formatting for the user.
