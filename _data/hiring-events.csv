As has been discovered elsewhere across the application, we appear to have a lot of non-interactive elements that contain _tabindex=""0""_. When we apply these unnecessarily, we can create confusion and unnecessary tab stops when navigating via keyboard. Not everything requires a tabindex. While not all of them have been discovered yet, let this serve as a reminder for the team that if they do come across more of these, that they will also likely need to be removed. 

As an additional reminder, elements should _only_ contain a tabindex of *-1* for _temporary_ focus and a tabindex of *0* if the component is custom and include a _role_ and _accessible name_.",Verify that extraneous _tabindex_ is removed and that element no longer received focus when tabbing.,"https://radancy.dev/a11y/audit/client/hiring-events/screengrab/A11YCHAT001-1.png

The status can be determined by the element adjacent to the button, so consider the following revisions instead: 

*Before* 

{code}<button type=""button"" class=""btn btn-material btn-sm btn-success"" aria-label=""Your status in Booth 1 is Not waiting to chat. Click Chat to start."" id=""BOOTH_GET_IN_LINE_BUTTON""><span>Chat</span> … </button>{code}

*TODO* 

1. Add a unique ID to the Chat Status. In this example, we use _chat-status_. 

2. Remove _aria-label_ from _button_ and add _aria-describedby=""chat-status""_. This will also aid eventual internationalization efforts.

Lastly, is this tooltip that appears when hovering over ""Not Waiting to Chat"" even necessary?

What I was expecting to be an example of the feature, using an image to cite how to save snippets, appears to be *actual* code that can be tabbed through, but not used, leading to confusion. While I did see _aria-hidden=""true""_ in abundant use (maybe more than needed), more care needs to be taken to hide interactive elements from keyboard users by using _tabindex=""-1""_. While I do see _tabindex_ in use on parent button elements, this appears to be a misunderstanding of how to properly hide interactive elements from keyboard users. For example, we have the following: 

{code}<div class=""message-actions-wrapper"" tabindex=""-1"" aria-hidden=""true"">

    <div class=""snippet-add"">

        <button type=""button"" class=""btn btn-default""></button>

    </div>

    <div class=""snippet-disabled"">

        <button type=""button"" class=""btn btn-default"" data-original-title="""" title=""""></button>

    </div>

</div>{code}

Here, the _tabindex_ lives on the parent element. This will not hide the code from keyboard jockeys. What it should be in order to properly bypass keyboard tabbing:

{code}<div class=""message-actions-wrapper"" aria-hidden=""true"">

    <div class=""snippet-add"">

        <button type=""button"" class=""btn btn-default"" tabindex=""-1""></button>

    </div>

    <div class=""snippet-disabled"">

        <button type=""button"" class=""btn btn-default"" data-original-title="""" title="""" tabindex=""-1""></button>

    </div>

</div>{code}

*TODO*

1. Review code block being produced for the snippets example and remove unnecessary use of _aria-hidden=""true""_. Placing it once,on the outermost element is all that is needed. Anything else is overkill. 

2. Remove _tabindex=""-1""_ from any outer elements and place them directly on the interactive element, as in the example above. 

In addition to this, there are also _div_ elements within this content that accept keyboard focus that should not be. For example: 

{code}<div class=""chat-message-section chat-me hidden-xs"" tabindex=""0"">

…

</div>{code}

Disabled users have certain expectations as to how tabs should operate which Radancy is not meeting here. 

The list items are particularly problematic. 

*Before* 

{code}<li class=""active"" role=""tab"" aria-controls=""gwt-uid-5"" aria-label="""" aria-selected=""true""> 

<a href=""javascript:;"" data-toggle=""tab"" data-target=""tab-panel-0"" tabindex=""0"">Overview</a>

</li>{code} 

*TODO* 

1. Add _role=""presentation""_ to each _li_. Since the _ul_ has _role=""tablist""_, this is no longer a normal list, but a tablist, so child elements must have their list semantics replaced with this role. Getting semantics correct is critical to help convey understanding of the structure being engaged with by people using assistive technology. 

2. Change _href=""javascript:;_ to _href=""#""_. For future-friendly enhancement I may ask for. Replacing with hash should not be an issue if return false is used on the link, which it likely is already. 

3. Move _role=""tab""_, _aria-controls_, and _aria-selected_ to the link itself. ARIA like this should never be used on non-interactive elements like _li_, unless tabindex is present. However, we want to avoid using _tabindex_ here so as to avoid a *double tab*, so moving these attributes to the link or button is always the best option. 

4. If _aria-label_ is not needed here, and I see no reason why it should be, then please remove it. 

5. Remove _tabindex_ from link. The tabindex is redundant and not required on interactive elements like _a_ or _button_ as they can *already be tabbed to without it*. 

6. Give each link a unique ID. For example, _id=""tab-item-01""_. This will be used by the content panel below the list. 

The tab panels themselves must be improved as well: 

*Before* 

{code}<div class=""tab-pane fade active in"" id=""gwt-uid-5"" role=""tabpanel"" aria-hidden=""false"" tabindex=""0""> ... </div>{code} 

*After* 

{code}<div class=""tab-pane fade active in"" id=""gwt-uid-5"" role=""tabpanel"" aria-hidden=""false"" aria-labelledby=""tab-item-01"" tabindex=""0""> ... </div>{code} 

1. Add _aria-labelledby_ to the tab panel and reference the ID of the newly added ID on the link. Doing so is good practice and provides context as to which tab is currently in use. 

Keyboard support needs *much* improvement here to comply. Arrow key support is an expectation here. 

1. When user presses the right or down arrow key, the focus should move from the active tab the user is currently on, to the inactive tab on the right, making the active and previous tab inactive. 

2. When the user presses the left or up arrow key, the focus should move from the active tab the user is currently on, to the inactive tab on the left, making the active and previous tab inactive. 

3. The tabs should cycle endlessly when tabbed though. In other words, moving left or right will bring user to an inactive tab, thereby making it active. 

4. Inactive tabs and panels should always be set to _tabindex=""-1""_, which currently appears to be present, so no action currently required. 

5. Tabbing from an active tab should bring user to the active tab panel only. This currently occurs but the focus is being suppressed here, which appears to be a much larger issue application wide. 

6. Tabbing from the active tab panel should bring user to the active tab only. This currently occurs but the focus is being suppressed here, which appears to be a much larger issue sitewide.

For example, on the Welcome screen, there is clearly the Brazen logo, but the alternative text says, ""Event logo"". Images should be accurately described, so I would expect ""Brazen Logo"" in this case, as this image is not functional but may still require alternative text to describe it to the end user.

My assumption here is that the default text is used because the admin does not seem to have the capability to include custom alternative text values. Perhaps the thinking of the Hiring Events team was that it's better to have some alternative text value than none, but this is not a good approach to accessibility. In accessibility, we aim to provide _equality_ across different viewing contexts, which we are not doing here. Therefore, I believe the best course of action now is to remove these generic alternative text values wherever they exist in the application, until the team can include a field to associate alternative text values with specific images. Should the team wish to eventually add this a feature to the admin, I will expect to be involved in early design phase to help steer in right direction and, of course, testing.

I believe that the primary culprit may be on the wrapper element _div[class=""page""]_, though it may exist elsewhere in the application, too. A developer who is familiar with the codebase will need to verify. For example: 

{code}<div class=""page booth-screen"" role=""application"" id=""BOOTH_PAGE_WIDGET""> … </div>{code}

According to MDN (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/application_role): 

_The *application* role indicates to assistive technologies that an element and all its children should be treated like a *desktop* application, and *no traditional HTML interpretation techniques should be used*. This role should only be used to define very dynamic and desktop-like web applications. *Most mobile and desktop web apps are not considered applications for this purpose.*_

Regarding keyboard access, I have run into dozens of difficulties with navigating the site with arrow and shortcut keys. For example, when I have my screen reader on, I should be able to press the _H_ key to navigate all headings on a page but cannot. Similar occurs when pressing my _T_ key to navigate pages that may include data tables. 

It is therefore my recommendation that we remove this role _wherever_ it may be found across the application. I do not think that removing it will have a negative impact for non-disabled users and that the application will continue to work as it does now (we'll find out in regression tho), but the benefit it will bring to disabled and/or keyboard-only users will be significant and solve a lot of (but not all) of the keyboard issues I and past auditors appear to have been experiencing. This issue was also cited by other clients.

1. The switches are missing focus states. It is very probable that focus is missing because the native element, _input[type=""checkbox""]_ is being hidden, while more aesthetically pleasing, custom controls are used to stand-in, which do not include a focus state. The custom control will therefore require a _custom_ outline here, like _outline: 2px solid #000;_. 

2. The toggle switch also does not appear to be reading back correctly. I am not hearing what I expect to hear and only hearing the state (on, off). We need to hear the label of the switch too, which is the date in this case. See https://radancy.dev/a11y/audit/client/hiring-events/screengrab/A11YGLOBAL015.mp4.

For example, take the ""Time Zone"" autocomplete found on many forms. It is not keyboard accessible, nor does it appear to be implementing the required ARIA to make the component better understood to assistive technology users. In regards to ARIA specifically, I see the component missing vital attributes that make such components more accessible, such as _aria-describedby_, _aria-expanded_, _aria-haspopup_, _aria-autocomplete_, _role (combobox)_, and _aria-controls_.

To learn more about comboxes please visit https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/combobox/ 

Alternatively, we may also wish to see how far native HTML elements, like _datalist_, have come along and understand where their support stands with assistive technology in 2024.

The only exception here is if it is useful and required to indicate suggestive, but non-critical data to be input into the field, for example, phone number formatting, When I say non-critial, the form will not throw an error if formatting because backend programming is going to take care of the formatting for the user.

Landmarks help assistive technology users understand the layout of the page at hand. Instead of creating ""div soup"" we can improve understanding and navigation through landmarks that have specific roles associated with them, and even specifically added. I do not expect this one to be addressed right now, but something that we should revisit soon. I really need to take deeper dive into the overall structure of the application to see where landmarks might be best suited, but this is considerable work and will therefore take time. As an example, on the Lobby (and other pages), we have our secondary navigation.

This section in question should be a list, with proper heading use. I'm seeing across the application that headings appear to be selected for their size and not their semantic relevance and relationship with other headings on the page. Getting HTML right, especially headings, is critical for certain user groups in being able to understand the page and even navigate (screen reader users can navigate by heading),

The following is a *first pass* at improving this component. I would like to revisit this after improvements ship to see if we can make further update to this UI. This might be a complicated one, so please reach out if there are any questions. 

h2.Card Wrapper

On _.booth-card_ wrapper, please do the following: 

*Before* 

{code}<div class=""booth-card"" role=""application"" tabindex=""0"" aria-describedby=""gwt-uid-370"" aria-label=""Accessibility with Spell: Booth 1. Press space bar to enter this booth."">{code}

*After* 

{code}<div class=""booth-card""> ... </div>{code}

*TODO*

1. Remove _role=""application""_.

2. Remove _tabindex=""0""_.

3. Remove _aria-describedby=""...""_.

4. Remove _aria-label=""...""_

These attributes do more harm than good here, so they all must go. We will be applying similar attributes elsewhere in card, where it is _actually_ needed.

h2.Images

On the non-custom, default _img_ element:

*Before*

{code}<img class="""" alt=""Booth Logo"" role=""presentation"" src=""..."" />{code}

*After*

{code}<img class="""" alt="""" src=""..."" />{code}

*TODO* 

1. Remove the alternative text value. As the image is decorative, it should always be a null alt. 

2. Remove _role=""presentation""_. As the alt text value is null, this will effectively hide the element from assistive technology. 

On the section with the custom image, I must ask: Why are we setting this as a background image? Why not utilize the _img_ element that is already present here instead of hiding it with _display: none_? If we can't utilize that image, then do the following: 

*Before*

{code}<div class=""inner"" aria-label=""Booth Image"" style=""background-image: url('https://res.cloudinary.com/brazen/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto,c_lfill,w_500,h_300,b_rgb:fff/v1719426400/tqlgxiefavtn5ouo0r8n.jpg');"">

    <img class="""" alt="""" role=""presentation"" aria-hidden=""true"" style=""display: none;"" />

    ...

</div>{code}

*After* 

{code}<div class=""inner"" style=""background-image: url('https://res.cloudinary.com/brazen/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto,c_lfill,w_500,h_300,b_rgb:fff/v1719426400/tqlgxiefavtn5ouo0r8n.jpg');"">

    <img class="""" alt="""" />

    ...

</div>{code}

*TODO*

1. Remove _aria-label_ from _.inner_ element. Question for [~anhill]: Do we provide a means for admin to add alternative text values to these images? If we do, then we may need to add _aria-label="" ...user entered value ... ""_ and _role=""img""_.

2. Remove _role=""presentation""_ and _""aria-hidden=""true""_, as they are not needed. The _presentation_ role is also not allowed on the _img_ element.

h2.Heading

On the _h4_ with a class of _.booth-title_, please do the following:

*Before*

{code}<h4 class=""booth-title"">...</h4>{code}

*After*

{code}<h2 class=""booth-title"">...</h2>{code}

*TODO*

Change _h4_ to _h2_. Adjust CSS as needed to retain same visual heading style. 

h2.Card Content

On the element with a class of _.booth-teaser_, we need to be able to scroll the content via keyboard, which currently does not work, if content exceeds set height. 

*Before* 

{code}<div class=""booth-teaser"" tabindex=""-1""> ... </div>{code}

*After* 

{code}<div class=""booth-teaser"" aria-label=""Booth Description"" role=""group"" tabindex=""0""> ... </div>{code}

*TODO*

1. Change _tabindex=""-1""_ to _tabindex=""0""_.

2. Add _aria-label=""Booth Description_. Please note that this label is suggestive. I would be open to seeing these be a little more contextual in nature.

3. Add _role=""group"".

h2.Booth Details

The additional details that load below the description also require numerous fixes to read back better to assistive technology. 

*Before*

{code}<p aria-hidden=""true"" style=""display: none;"">Job Info</p>

</ul>{code}

*TODO* 

1. *Optional:* Remove _aria-hidden=""true""_ when used with _display: none;_. Both _aria-hidden=""true""_ and _display: none_ do the same thing, so if you need to hide an element from both disabled and non-disabled users, you need only use _display: none_.

2. Change _div_ and _span_ to a proper list element. 

3. Remove extraneous _tabindex=""0""_ elements. 

4. Add a visual label next to each item. Location, Job Type, etc. It needs to be clear what each of these list items are, which may not be conveyed by the values listed here.

There are a few issues here that we need to remedy: 

The modal does not have an accessible name. While it is using _aria-describedby_ to point to a description, this is not the same thing and extremely verbose I might add, and so the modal should include a more concise name to easily describe it to users. We can do this with _aria-label_ or better, we can apply an ID to the heading and point to that using _aria-labelledby_, which is not only great for accessibility but internationalization, as well. For example: 

{code}<div role=""dialog"" aria-labelledby=""hdr-ID"">

    <h1 id=""hdr-ID"">Thank you for your Interest</h1>

    …

</div>{code} 

*TODO*

1. Remove _aria-describedby_. A description is not necessary here. Often, this points to extremely verbose sections of content, the content itself, which is not necessary for a screen reader user to hear.

2. Please make the _h4_ an _h1_ element. All the other content on the page is _inert_ when dialog is active, so this should be the primary heading now. At times, this may be flagged as an issue, but it should be okay to do. Adjust styling as needed. 

3. Ensure that dialog can be dismissed using the Escape key. 

4. When dialog is dismissed, focus needs to be managed and placed _back_ on the element that initiated it. In this case, the ""Leave a Note"" button.

*Note:* This is a common issue with dialogs across the application, so while the auditor may not cite every single instance here, we still need to make sure that what we are addressing here, is addressed elsewhere across the application.

In addition to the issue with the modal itself, the content of the dialog has the following issues: 

1. The _textarea_ is missing a visible and programmatically associated label.

2. After hitting ""Send"", focus appears to be lost, and the user needs to tab through the entire interface again. As when we hit the escape key or ""Close"" button, focus should be managed here and placed back on the element that initiated the dialog (Leave a Note).","Verify that dialog is now has proper markup in place, focus is managed where needed, and component can be used properly with keyboard.",https://radancy.dev/a11y/audit/client/hiring-events/screengrab/A11YLOBBY009.png,,"""HE_Lobby"", ""S4_Low"", ""Effort_Difficult"", ""Issue_Dialog"", ""Specialist_Support""",Critical,Fail,Product Support,Failed in Preview,,,0
