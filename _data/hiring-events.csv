Disabled users have certain expectations as to how tabs should operate which Radancy is not meeting here. 

The list items are particularly problematic. 

Before: 

<li class=""active"" role=""tab"" aria-controls=""gwt-uid-5"" aria-label="""" aria-selected=""true"">

<a href=""javascript:;"" data-toggle=""tab"" data-target=""tab-panel-0"" tabindex=""0"">Overview</a>

</li>

After:  

<li class=""active"" role=""presentation"">

<a aria-controls=""gwt-uid-5"" aria-selected=""true"" data-toggle=""tab"" data-target=""tab-panel-0"" href=""#"" id=""tab-item-01"" role=""tab"">Overview</a>

</li>

TODO/Success Criteria 

1. Add role=""presentation"" to each li. Since there is a tablist role on the outer ul, this is no longer a text list, but a tablist, so child elements must have their list semantics replaced with ""presentation"". Getting semantics correct is critical to help convey understanding of the structure being engaged with. 

2. Change href=""javascript:; to href=""#"". For future-friendly enhancement I may ask for. Replacing with hash should not be an issue if return false is used on the link, which it likely is already. 

3. Move role=""tab"", aria-controls, and aria-selected to the link itself. ARIA like this should never be used on non-interactive elements like a li, unless tabindex is present. However, want to avoid tabindex here to avoid a double tab, so moving these attributes to the link or button is always the best choice. 

4. If aria-label is not needed here, then please remove it. 

5. Remove tabindex from link. The tabindex is redundant and not required on interactive elements like <a> or <button> as they can already be tabbed to without it.

6. Give each link a unique ID. For example, id=""tab-item-01"". This will be used by the content panel below the list. 

The tab panels themselves could must be improved as well: 

Before: 

<div class=""tab-pane fade active in"" id=""gwt-uid-5"" role=""tabpanel"" aria-hidden=""false"" tabindex=""0""> ... </div>

After: 

<div class=""tab-pane fade active in"" id=""gwt-uid-5"" role=""tabpanel"" aria-hidden=""false"" aria-labelledby=""tab-item-01"" tabindex=""0""> ... </div>

1. Add aria-labelledby to the tab panel and reference the ID of the newly added ID on the link. Doing so is good practice and provides context as to which tab is currently in use. 

Keyboard support needs MUCH improvement here to comply. Arrow keys are expectation here. 

1. When user presses the right or down arrow key, the focus should move from the active tab the user is currently on, to the inactive tab on the right, making the active and previous tab inactive. 

2. When the user presses the left or up arrow key, the focus should move from the active tab the user is currently on, to the inactive tab on the left, making the active and previous tab inactive. 

3. The tabs should cycle endlessly when tabbed though. In other words, moving left or right will bring user to an inactive tab, thereby making it active.

4. Inactive tabs and panels should always be set to tabindex -1, which currently appears to be present, so no action currently required. 

5. Tabbing from an active tab should bring user to the active tab panel only. This currently occurs but the focus is being suppressed here, which appears to be a much larger issue sitewide. 

6. Tabbing from the active tab panel should bring user to the active tab only. This currently occurs but the focus is being suppressed here, which appears to be a much larger issue sitewide. 

Please see the pattern Radancy currently uses for many of its career site Tablist. The semantics and behavior are a good example of what the Hiring Events component should be striving for.  See https://radancy.dev/component-library/tablist/

6. On the disclosure content div (.panel-collapse), please remove aria-expanded. This is not allowed on non-interactive elements.

This section should be a list, with proper heading use. I'm seeing across application that headings are selected for size and not their semantic relevance and used inappropriately in general. Would like to have 1:1 with Kate and team to discuss this issue further as the problem is too numerous to keep citing cross-platform. However, in this example, we appear to have the following: 

<div ...>

	<h1>1</h1>

	<h2>Register</h2>

	<p>Create an account....</p>

</div>

Ideally, we would change to the following: 

<ol>

	<li>

		<h3><span class=""step"">1</span> Register</h3>

		<p>Create an account...</p>

	</li>

	...
